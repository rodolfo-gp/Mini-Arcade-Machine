## Description
This repository is an archive of the arcade machine project code and a demonstration. Unfortunately, the source code for the project was lost.

Our mini portable arcade machine was designed and created using an Arduino, a screen, a joystick, a buzzer, and 3D printing techniques. The programming was done in C++ along with various libraries to effectively utilize the Arduino components from the kit. The 3D modeling was meticulously designed to ensure easy access and replacement of any components that might fail. Circuit design and programming were optimized for efficiency, allowing the machine to operate fully within the power constraints of a classic 9V battery.
